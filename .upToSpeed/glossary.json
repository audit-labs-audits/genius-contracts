Liquidity providers stake their assets using functions like `stakeDeposit()`, which increases both the total staked assets and available assets in the vault according to a predetermined ratio. In return for providing liquidity, they earn a portion of the protocol's trading fees tracked as `lpFeesCollected`, which can be claimed through the `claimLPFees()` function by authorized distributors. The protocol carefully accounts for LP contributions, maintains minimum liquidity thresholds through functions like `minLiquidity()`, and allows providers to withdraw their assets using operations such as `removeBridgeLiquidity()`. Liquidity providers are essential to the protocol's functionality, ensuring sufficient assets are available for trades while being compensated for the capital they contribute and the risks they assume."

Cross-chain transactions introduce additional delay and price movement risk\n\nThe protocol implements price bounds checking (typically 2% as seen in `testEdgeCasePrices()` where 0.98-1.02 is the acceptable range) and minimum output amounts (`minAmountOut`) to protect users from excessive slippage. If the actual execution price falls outside these bounds, the transaction reverts with errors like `PriceOutOfBounds` or fails silently by returning the original tokens to the user.\n\nUnderstanding slippage is essential when constructing trades in the Genius protocol, particularly when working across chains or in volatile market conditions."

When a user creates a stop-loss order, they specify parameters including the asset, amount, and price boundaries. The system continuously monitors asset prices through price feeds, and if the price moves outside the specified bounds (typically 2-3% deviation as shown in the price tests), the order automatically executes.\n\nFor example, from `GeniusVault.t.sol`, we can see price boundaries being enforced:\n\n```solidity\n// Test with price too low (0.97 USD)\nMOCK_PRICE_FEED.updatePrice(97_000_000);\nvm.expectRevert(\n    abi.encodeWithSelector(\n        GeniusErrors.PriceOutOfBounds.selector,\n        97_000_000\n    )\n);\n```\n\nThis ensures that when assets reach predetermined unfavorable prices, the order triggers automatically, selling the position and preventing further losses.

The `rebalanceThreshold` function further suggests the protocol dynamically reallocates liquidity to maintain optimal concentration levels.\n\nWhen liquidity is concentrated in active trading ranges, it provides several benefits:\n- Higher capital efficiency (using less capital to provide the same depth)\n- Better execution prices for traders in active ranges\n- Potentially higher returns for liquidity providers through more efficient fee generation\n- Reduced impermanent loss when properly configured\n\nThis approach represents an evolution beyond the constant product formula (x*y=k) used in earlier AMM designs, allowing for more sophisticated market making that can adapt to different market conditions."

    "definition": "# Top-of-Block (ToB)\n\nTop-of-Block (ToB) is a specialized transaction ordering mechanism used in blockchain systems that ensures certain transactions are executed at the very beginning of a new block, before any other transactions. \n\nThis priority execution is particularly valuable in decentralized exchanges and trading systems where execution timing can significantly impact outcomes. ToB orders typically contain specifications for asset quantities, gas limits, validity constraints tied to specific block numbers, and recipient information.\n\nThe key advantage of ToB orders is their ability to mitigate frontrunning risks and reduce slippage by guaranteeing execution position within the block. Traders use ToB orders to capitalize on fleeting market inefficiencies or execute time-sensitive trades with minimal interference from other market participants.\n\nImplementation of ToB requires coordination between smart contract logic and block production mechanisms to identify, validate, and prioritize these special transactions during the block creation process."
